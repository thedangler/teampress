I'm going to try and make a version of buddypress that is team oriented.

Registering you would register and be assigned for a team.
If you do not belong to a team you can create one or register as a free agent.
Users can belong to multiple teams

Will Try to focus on team profiles, states and automation for updates


Currently buddypress is more user oriented we are about to change that.

If you want to help let me know.
